# Inventory-management-system

Inventory management system using ReactJS and MongoDB with user authentication, start by setting up a MongoDB database, preferably using MongoDB Atlas for ease of access and scalability. Next, set up your backend with Express and Mongoose, defining models for users and products, and implementing routes for user registration and login with bcrypt for password hashing and JWT for authentication. Concurrently, initialize a React project and install necessary dependencies like Axios for API calls and React Router for navigation. Create context and components for authentication, including a login component that handles user authentication and saves JWT tokens. Design a sidebar in your React app with navigation options, and display inventory data in a main content area, using state management to handle data fetching and rendering dynamically based on user interactions. Ensure the frontend communicates with the backend APIs for CRUD operations on inventory items. Finally, run your backend server and the React development server to test and iterate on your application, making improvements as needed. This setup offers a robust foundation for building a secure, scalable inventory management system with a user-friendly interface.
